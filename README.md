• Made modifications in the .ucf file to switch on all the led on the Spartan-3 fpga board • Programmed the fpga board using Xillinx • Explained to the TA in class the "Assign Package Pins" and how the code changes if we change the circuit diagram changes. The .ucf file acts like a constraint for the circuit components.
